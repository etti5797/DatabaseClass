# DatabaseClass
 Databases Course 2024 - task's grade: 100

 In this assignment, we developed a part of a delivery management application to help the restaurant manage orders more efficiently.
 

Here's what we accomplished:

-Database Design: We designed a comprehensive database schema (ERD) to support the application's functionalities, ensuring that all necessary entities, such as customers, orders, and menu items, were represented.

-SQL Tables, Views, and Queries: we created Tables based on the ERD design, ensuring the correct data types and constraints for each table. We created SQL views to simplify complex queries and make data retrieval more efficient.



During the project, we faced some challenges, like creating a clear database structure and improving the performance of database queries.


What we learned from this project includes how to design a database and develop an API, as well as how to create an effective data access system.


This project provided practical experience in using SQL to build an effective delivery management system for restaurants. It was a lot of fun to explore this field and see our work come to lifeðŸ˜Š
